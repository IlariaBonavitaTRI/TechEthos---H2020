# TechEthos - media scan analysis

TechEthos is an EU-funded project (EU H2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 101006249) that deals with the ethics of the new and emerging technologies anticipated to have high socio-economic impact. The project involves ten scientific partners and six science engagement organisations and run from January 2021 to the end of 2023.

This folder contains the scripts to generate statistics and visuals developed within the purposes of the project deliverable "[D3.3 - Results of media analysis](https://www.techethos.eu/results-of-media-analysis/)" associated with the task of performing a media scan and analysis on the three technology families of interest to the project: geoengineering, digital extended reality, and neurotechnology. This task, led by [Trilateral Research](https://trilateralresearch.com/about) was interested in the representation of these technologies in the media as media discourse both reflects and shapes public perception, awareness, and acceptance of technologies. It focused on the media in 13 different countries. This included ten EU countries: Austria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Romania, Spain, and Sweden and three non-EU countries: Serbia, UK, and USA.
